# Galactic War Multiplanetary Systems

Collates multiplanetary systems with multiplanetary starts into a single map tab to allow players to easily add a wide array of multiplanetary systems to their war. [Shared Systems for Galactic War](https://forums.planetaryannihilation.com/threads/rel-shared-systems-for-galactic-war.71533/) is installed as a dependency to allow this to work.

Maps are not included with this mod; they are loaded in maps from map packs you already have installed.

Any maps reliant on server mods have not been included as these will not work in Galactic War.
