# Galactic War Multiplanetary Systems

Collates multiplanetary systems with multiplanetary starts into a single map tab. This is designed for use with Shared Systems for Galactic War, to allow players to easily add a wide array of multiplanetary systems to their war.

Maps are not included with this mod, instead it will load in maps from map packs you have installed. This allows you to avoid the use of map packs you don't like, and ensures this mod is always providing you the latest version of the map so long as the map pack author doesn't change the file path.

Any maps reliant on server mods have not been included as these will not work in Galactic War.

## Supported Map Packs

- Grand Homie
- WPMarshall
